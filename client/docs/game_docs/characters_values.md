| Archetype      | Personality Tag            | What they’re like                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Striker**    | **Relentless Goal-Seeker** | Lives for big-match moments, thrives under pressure, and loves the roar of the crowd. Confident to the point of cocky—if benched, expect fireworks. Natural leader in the dressing room but can butt heads with authority when his star status feels threatened.                  |
| **Dribbler**   | **Charismatic Showman**    | Plays to entertain. Loves highlight-reel flair, social media limelight, and fan interaction. Friendly and upbeat, but that ego can flare if team tactics stifle his creativity. Expect cheeky nutmegs … and the occasional risky over-dribble.                                    |
| **Play-maker** | **Cerebral Orchestrator**  | Calm, analytical, and team-first. Sees the whole field two steps ahead, sets the tempo, and keeps locker-room egos in check. Makes teammates better, and media loves his thoughtful interviews—but rivals may brand him “too nice” until he slices them apart with a killer pass. |
